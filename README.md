## 100+ items with images for use
I put this together for my own server that I'm working on, but I thought I would share the items & effects. I'll add to it as I edit and add more items and I will notate which files go where in the client / server code so that it should be easy to put together. I also added the latest weapons from the recent updates.

##### Image Quality: *I use adobe illustrator to cut out & size the images, without losing too much of the quality*
