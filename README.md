## Items Template for [Ox_Inventory](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory)
I put this together for my own server that I'm working on, but I thought I would share the items & effects. I'll add to it as I edit and add more items. I will notate which files go where in the client / server code so that it should be easy to put together.

All I've done is make the items and make most of them work like they should. I didn't make any of the ox scripts nor am I part of the development team, all of the credit goes to [Linden](https://github.com/thelindat) and the [OverExtended Team](https://github.com/overextended). If you have any questions beyond "how do I add an item" or "what is a lua file", go check out their [documentation](https://overextended.github.io/docs/).

I'm here for the community and I support the idea to *learn* how to do these things on your own. It's the best way to make sure you don't waste any time, money, or get scammed.I'm also going to update this as I work it for my own server, so hopefully this can give you some enrichment for your server(s). I'm also open to ideas, cause that sounds fun.
